# SkyChainTrace

A blockchain-powered platform for tracing aircraft parts and maintenance histories, enhancing aviation safety by providing immutable provenance and reducing the risk of counterfeit components — all on-chain.

---

## Overview

SkyChainTrace consists of four main smart contracts that together form a decentralized, transparent, and secure ecosystem for aircraft manufacturers, suppliers, airlines, and regulators:

1. **Parts NFT Contract** – Issues and manages unique NFTs representing aircraft parts for traceability.
2. **Supply Chain Transfer Contract** – Handles secure transfers of part ownership and logs supply chain events.
3. **Maintenance Log Contract** – Records and verifies maintenance activities linked to specific parts.
4. **Oracle Verification Contract** – Integrates with off-chain data sources for real-world validation and updates.

## Features

- **NFT-based part identification** for unique, tamper-proof digital twins of physical components  
- **Immutable supply chain tracking** from manufacturer to end-user  
- **On-chain maintenance records** with timestamped events and certifications  
- **Automated verification** via oracles for authenticity checks and compliance  
- **Stakeholder incentives** through token rewards for accurate reporting  
- **Decentralized governance hooks** for industry standards updates  
- **Reduced counterfeit risks** by enabling quick audits and recalls  
- **Integration with existing aviation databases** for seamless adoption

## Smart Contracts

### Parts NFT Contract
- Mint NFTs for new aircraft parts with metadata (serial number, manufacturer, specs)
- Update metadata for lifecycle events (e.g., installation, removal)
- Burn NFTs for decommissioned or scrapped parts

### Supply Chain Transfer Contract
- Secure transfer of NFT ownership between entities (manufacturer → supplier → airline)
- Log transfer history with timestamps and signatures
- Enforce compliance rules (e.g., only certified entities can transfer)

### Maintenance Log Contract
- Record maintenance events (inspections, repairs) linked to part NFTs
- Require multi-signature approvals for critical logs
- Queryable history for audits and regulatory compliance

### Oracle Verification Contract
- Connect to off-chain aviation data providers (e.g., FAA databases, manufacturer APIs)
- Verify part authenticity and trigger on-chain updates
- Handle dispute resolutions through oracle consensus
